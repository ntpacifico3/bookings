          <h3>Neil's Passion</h3>
          
          <p>I started my career in acute care and academic settings. An opportunity came where I was involved in a research project in Japan to understand the available support of foreign families with children with developmental disabilities. I have also worked with professionals who specialize in psychiatry and mental health and community integration. This presented me with a different perspective and opened my interest in mental health. It was then that I discovered my passion for helping individuals with development disabilities and psychiatric & mental health crises.</p>
          <p>Mental health crises are nobody's fault. Any of our loved ones can and may experience concerns about their mental health. This may be due to chemical imbalances in our brain or triggered by traumatic experiences. It is critical for YOU to know that it is okay to seek help. There is strength in knowing that we need help.</p>
          <p>Being in the psychiatric and mental health field, I have seen patients in acute crisis and successfully integrated back into the community and reached an optimal level of function. I believe that mental health is a partnership amongst all that are part of an individual’s care. This includes you and your family.</p>
          <p>With my passion and long academic & clinical preparation, I volunteer myself to be of service for you and your family. You will be the center of your care. I am here with you in your journey to mental wellness.</p>
